# 🎉 DSA Fun – Visualize. Collaborate. Learn. 🎯

> A community-driven repository to make **Data Structures & Algorithms** not just understandable, but **fun, visual, and interactive!**

---

## 🚀 What is DSA Fun?

**DSA Fun** is an open-source initiative to learn and teach **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** by **building visual, interactive, and creative projects** that bring abstract concepts to life.

From **tree traversals animations**, **sorting visualizers**, **graph algorithms**, to cool **backtracking simulations like N-Queens** – we want to make learning DSA **visually intuitive** and **collaborative**.

---

## 🔥 Why This Repo?

- DSA is hard to grasp when it's only theoretical.
- Visualization makes concepts click 💡.
- We're building a **playground for DSA lovers** who enjoy building and learning together.
- 💪 You learn better by **building + explaining + sharing**.

## 🧠 Ideas Already in Action

| Visualizer | Status |
|------------|--------|
| ✅ N-Queens Step-by-Step Visualizer | `React + Tailwind` |
| 🔄 Binary Tree Traversals (DFS, BFS) | `Coming Soon` |
| 🔄 Graph Traversals / Dijkstra | `Planned` |
| 🔄 Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Quick) | `Planned` |
| ✅ Heapify Process & Top-K Elements | `React + Motion` |
